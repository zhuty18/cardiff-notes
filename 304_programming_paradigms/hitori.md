## For

1. Puzzle problems, like Hitori, are just initial status and a set of rules. It's the situation ASP is made for. Coding in ASP is much more straightforward and simple.
2. 

## Against

1. Hitori puzzle requires a lot of computing. ASP is not as fast as some other languages (e.g, C++), using ASP to solve some complicated puzzles may take unbearable time.
2. 

<!-- ASP has very strict grammar, which makes building test inputs in ASP quite annoying. It slows down the velocity of developing programs, especially debugging. -->
